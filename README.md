##  Project Overview

This project analyzes customer support ticket data to identify patterns in resolution time, SLA adherence, backlog volume and shift-wise performance.  
The goal is to uncover operational inefficiencies and support data-driven decisions in managing support resources and ticket prioritization.

---

##  Objectives

- Track overall ticket volume by shift and priority  
- Analyze SLA breach rates across ticket types  
- Measure and compare average resolution time by support shift  
- Monitor backlog of unresolved critical and high-priority tickets  
- Enable shift- and priority-level filtering for deeper insights  
- Visualize support performance KPIs in an interactive dashboard  

---

##  Data Cleaning (Excel)

- Removed irrelevant columns: `gender`, `age`, `email`  
- Renamed unclear or inconsistent column names for clarity  
- Created new calculated fields for analysis:
  - `Resolution Status` â€“ based on whether the ticket was resolved  
  - `Resolution Time (hrs)` â€“ duration between ticket creation and closure  
  - `SLA Breach Flag` â€“ identifies tickets breaching SLA thresholds  
  - `Shift` â€“ derived from ticket creation timestamp  
  - `Status Categorized` â€“ grouped detailed status values into categories

##  Key Insights

- **Afternoon shift** receives the highest ticket volume  
- **Night shift** has the longest average resolution time â†’ potential staffing issue  
- **High-priority tickets** have an SLA breach rate of **8%**  
- Over **30%** of critical priority tickets remain unresolved  
- **Phone support** performs best in SLA compliance, with a **96%** rate

##  Conclusion

The dashboard provides clear visibility into support operations, highlighting key issues like SLA breaches, delayed resolutions and unresolved high-priority tickets. These insights enable data-driven decisions to improve response efficiency, allocate resources better across shifts and enhance overall service quality.
